Astronomer's assistant

This app combines several useful features for astronomers during observation evenings.
It allows you to:
- the date, local time, UTC time, and daylight saving time (DST)
- the GPS position of the location
- use the flashlight
- create a red night light
- compass
- weather (based on the smartphone's sensors: temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction)

It's free, open source, does not require an internet connection, and no data is collected.
The app is available on the Google Store
